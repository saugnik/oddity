In this project, I designed and simulated a rover wheel and a rocker-bogie suspension system using ANSYS, focusing on terrain adaptability and mechanical stabilityâ€”key components in planetary exploration rovers. The simulation involved creating accurate 3D CAD models, meshing them for finite element analysis (FEA), and applying realistic boundary conditions to mimic the effects of off-road or extraterrestrial surfaces.

The rocker-bogie mechanism, known for its ability to keep all six wheels in contact with the ground on rough terrain, was analyzed for load distribution, stress response, and deformation under varying terrain slopes and obstacle heights. I used contact and joint constraints to replicate real-world mechanical interactions between linkages and the ground.

For the rover wheel, I performed simulations to study traction, wheel-soil interaction, and material endurance under different loading conditions. This allowed me to evaluate how different wheel designs and materials affect performance on sandy, rocky, or inclined surfaces.

Through this work, I gained practical experience in multibody dynamics, structural analysis, and design validation using simulation tools. The project highlights my skills in mechanical modeling, problem-solving, and applying simulation techniques to complex real-world robotic systems.
